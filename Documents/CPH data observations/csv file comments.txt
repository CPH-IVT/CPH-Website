A readme needs to be created that documents the contents of the various CSVs.

CensusDivisions.csv, CensusRegions.csv
-.  Why do some regions share region codes?  e.g., Mountain and Pacific?
-.  Do these codes relate at all to the States divisions?

Counties.csv, Counties-org.csv
-.  Why two separate files?
-.  Why is Counties.csv apparently incomplete?

States.csv
-.  I assume these are ISO state codes.  A reference to a source seems important.
-.  what are the FIPS codes?  Also, why are codes missing?
    specifically, 3, 7, 14, 43, 52, 57-59, 61-65, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 75-77
-.  what are the divisions?   I can guess - but, again, this is undocumented.
