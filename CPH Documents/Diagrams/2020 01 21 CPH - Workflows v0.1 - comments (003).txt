Hello, Josh -

Thanks for the start.  My feedback on what you've provided is divided into two parts:
-.  some comments on the process of building workflows
-.  some comments on the workflows proper

Comments on the process:

*.  For me, two of the most critical steps in completing a professional
    quality application are
    -.  anticipating and planning for anomalies
    -.  anticipating and planning for accountability, in the form of
        -.  messages to logs
        -.  messages to users
    Most of the comments below address the need to expand the workflows
    to address these "what if?" scenarios.
    And, if you think I'm making this too complicated, let me quote Warner Vogels,
    head of AWS:
        "Everything fails all the time."

*.  When you redo the workflows, use explicit inter-workflow connectors to join
    a unique workflow to its shared workflows - much as people do in circuit diagrams
   
*.  Have you communicated with Shayne and Ed about these workflows?
   
*.  Will you please communicate with Shayne and Ed after addressing my concerns?
   
*.  After you, Shayne, and Ed come to an agreement on the workflows, I'd like to correct the
    spelling in the originals.  What you've sent me is ... off.
    
*.  Also, when the issues raised below are addressed, should we update the requirements
    document to capture the answers?
    
Now, for the workflows:

*.  Generally
    *.  needed - a common workflow for server anomalies
    -.  What should be done/noted if the server is inaccessible?
            -.  possibilities:  bad command, command failure (e.g., space issues)
            -.  how to recover in midst of a multi-step process?
            -.  more careful separate workflow?
    *.  needed - a more precise common workflow for server anomalies
        -.  What should be done/noted if the database is inaccessible?
            -.  possibilities:  service inaccessible, bad command, command failure (e.g., space issues)
            -.  how to recover in midst of a multi-step process?
            -.  more careful separate workflow?
    *.  needed - a common workflow for file system anomalies
        -.  What should be done/noted if the file system is inaccessible?
            -.  possibilities:  bad command, command failure (e.g., permission issues, missing files)
            -.  how to recover in midst of a multi-step process?
            -.  more careful separate workflow?
    *.  needed - more thought for notifications
        -.  for everywhere where a notification is required, who should be notified?
            -.  The master admin(s)?
            -.  The data admin(s)?
        -.  needed - a common workflow for notifications and their anomalies
            -.  For registered users, through the website?
                -.  What happens if the user is logged off when the notification is required -
                    e.g., on an upload from CHR
            -.  Via e-mail?
                -.  What happens if e-mail is unreachable?
    *.  needed - a common workflow fo rlogging
        -.  What steps in the process should be logged?
        -.  What happens if logging fails?
    
*.  System installation workflow
    -.  Need this as well, including (e.g.) establishing initial admin account and password
    -.  Should remote, web-based installation be permitted?
    -.  Contingencies
        -.  Insufficient disk space on server
        -.  Password strength inadequate
        -.  Application installation failure
            -.  Database
        -.  Service initialization failure
    
*.  Uploading data
    -.  Join the two into a single flow
        -.  Use a connector to from the uploading data workflow make the connection clear
    -.  Who should be authorized to upload data?
        -.  Any master admin?  (I'd say yes)
        -.  Any data admin?    (I'd say yes)
    -.  Contingencies - what happens if
        -.  Server inaccessible
        -.  Database inaccessible
        -.  File system inaccessible
        -.  The data to upload has already been uploaded to the website
        -.  Upload to the host fails partway through workload, due to
            -.  Failure to access the CHR website
        -.  The attempt to transform the content for storage in CPH-IVT fails, due to
            -.  Invalid / corrupt CHR data format?
        -.  The attempt to load the CPH-IVT with data fails
   -.  Notifications
        -.  Who should be notified on an upload?
        -.  How should the process be logged?

*.  Registration workflow (users)
    -.  Do we need two registration processes - one for ETSU users and one for external users?
        -.  For internal users, e-number will work as their UID
        -.  If we register external users, do we use their e-mail as their SUID?
    -.  Contingencies
        -.  Server inaccessible
        -.  Database inaccessible
        -.  Invalid attempt to register - specifics
            -.  User name already taken - how is this treated
                -.  Typically, not as forgotten user name
            -.  E-mail for registration already in use?
                -.  Different sites handle this differently
            -.  Invalid user data: e.g.,
                -.  Invalid name
                    -.  Check for bogus characters
                -.  Invalid e-mail address
                    -.  Disallow e-mail address capture for ETSU users?
                -.  Weak password
                    -.  Do we enforce strong password requirements, and, if so, for what roles?
    -.  Notifications
        -.  Who should be notified on an attempt to register?
        -.  How should the process be logged?

*.  Read and possibly modify user account data workflow (users)
    -.  Need to allow user to change 
        -.  Password
        -.  Possibly e-mail address
        -.  Other personal data?
    -.  Contingencies
        -.  Server inaccessible
        -.  Database inaccessible
        -.  Invalid attempt to register - specifics

            -.  Weak password?
    -.  Notifications
        -.  Who should be notified on an attempt to register?
        -.  How should the process be logged?

        -.  Removal of self when self is master administrator
    -.  Notifications
        -.  Who should be notified on an attempt to register?
        -.  How should the process be logged?

*.  Add user workflow (master admin)
    -.  Similar but not identical to registration workflow - initiated by master admin
    -.  Contingencies
        -.  Server inaccessible
        -.  Database inaccessible
        -.  The user to add is already in the system
    -.  Notifications
        -.  Who should be notified when a user is added?
        -.  How should the process be logged?

    -.  Notifications
        -.  Who should be notified when a user is removed?
        -.  How should the process be logged?

*.  Remove user workflow (admin)
    -.  Removal of the last user needs to differentiate between
        -.  Removal of the last person whose role is master administrator
        -.  Removal of any other users, since, given the presence of a master admin,
            any role can be added
    -.  Contingencies - what happens if
